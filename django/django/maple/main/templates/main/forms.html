 	<h5>Forms and reports</h5>
 	<p>
 		This page is served directly from Django and allows submitting of forms and downloading standard reports. Anything requiring any more than just a CSV download I will tend to put in an embedded shiny application but this shows an alternative way to do it. <br/><br/>

    These forms are variations of Model forms in Django which are generally cleaner to use. I tend to keep forms and views close to models and these ones are all in the <i>data_assets</i> module.

 If you are managing alot of assets and alot of associated data APIs, you need an easy way to let people know if there has been some kind of security breach. This form is posted straight and in the related view, place to hold other logic, like send an email advice. The html is generated by Django in this form.

  Often its not enough to just static data: you need a way to accept requests about data. The good news is that I have a module for that. A basic request form. This can be modifed to request data or start a project. There are different ways to manage this, depending on your semantics of the research group.
