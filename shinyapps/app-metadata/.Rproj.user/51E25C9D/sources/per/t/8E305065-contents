        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <br/>
          This page holds the full metadata specifications for all Institute data assets, including system data, extract data, analytics data, reporting data, auxillary data, and sample data (see definitions below).
          
          Each data asset specification contains an overview, a list of users and roles, and supporting documentation (including its internal HPRM reference where applicable). Supporting documentation also includes usage notes where available that provide information about data element quality, coverage, caveats for analytics and guidelines for in publications and reporting.
        <br/>
        <br/>
   
          For the Analytics data assets, a shared, Institute wide data dictionary is also available<a href="/app-ci-interactive-dictionary/"> here</a>. This provides provides detailed information on the data element naming conventions, validation and transformation rules, quality and coverage metrics, extended usage notes, and allows for the creation of custom data dictionaries.

       <h4>Types of data assets held in the Cancer Institute</h4>
       <br/>
              <b>System</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        System data is in held in source appplications managed by the Institute. This category is included predominantly to track internal users of applications. Most staff will not have access to system data.
       </div>
       <br/>
       <b>Extract</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        Extract data is data taken from source systems (for example internal software applications and external data feeds from LHDs). This data requires cleaning for use in analytics and reporting and does not use standard CI naming conventions. You can access this data directly via an ODBC connection for your analytics tool of choice, and details to do this can be found on the resources page. 
       </div>
       <br/>
       <b>Analytics</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        This data has been cleaned and is ready for use and has conformed naming. This mean that where a data element has the same name in different Analytics datasets, it can be used interchangeably (for example, LHD names will have the same type/accepted values across these datasets). You can access this data directly via an ODBC connection for your analytics tool of choice, and details to do this can be found on the resources page. 
       </div>
       <br/>
       <b>Reporting</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        These data assets are the standard reports created in the Institute for external agencies, such as AIHW and CheRel. In most cases, data elements will require renaming before being used in these reports and the supporting documentation tab holds these mappings.
       </div>
       <br/>
       <b>Auxillary</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        Auxillary data assets includes both internal administrative data (such as the data glossary and standard text used in internal websites) and reference
        data used to create analytics datasets (for example, postcode data, list of ICD-10 cancer codes, etc.)
       </div>
       <br/>
       <b>Sample</b>
       <br/>
       <div>
        Some sample data assets have been included and are an ideal way to get started. These are publically available cancer related data assets, and can be
        used without restriction. They are also ideal for training.
