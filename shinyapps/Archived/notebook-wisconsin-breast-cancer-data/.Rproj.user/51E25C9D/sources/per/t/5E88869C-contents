### Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset - Dictionary and Usage Notes

#### Overview
***
This data has been made available as a sample dataset for Cancer Insitute Staff. The data is a commonly used machine learning dataset, well suited for training purposes. The data was originally released by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, and made available for research on January 8, 1991. There are  699 observations in the data (as of 15 July 1992), and the data is made available from the following sources:  

<br/>

* Dr. WIlliam H. Wolberg (physician), University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison, Wisconsin, USA  
* Donor: Olvi Mangasarian (mangasarian@cs.wisc.edu), received by David W. Aha (aha@cs.jhu.edu).

#### Attributes
***
The dataset has <b>699</b> observations, with each observation having <b>11</b> attributes. An additional attribute has been added to denote a version number for the dataset. Attributes are listed below:

#### Usage notes  
<hr/>

All obervations indicate samples that ahve arrive periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data. This grouping information can be seen below, and it should be noted that the date of collection has not been included with the data.

  Group               No. Instances          Date collected
 ---------     ----------------------  -----------------------------------
 Group 1:       367 instances             (January 1989)
 Group 2:       70 instances              (October 1989)
 Group 3:       31 instances              (February 1990)
 Group 4:       17 instances              (April 1990)
 Group 5:       48 instances              (August 1990)
 Group 6:       49 instances              (Updated January 1991)
 Group 7:       31 instances              (June 1991)
 Group 8:       86 instances              (November 1991)
 
 
    
Note that some of the research from this set has been undertaken on a smaller subset of this data, using Group 1 above. That research used 369 observations, 2 of which have subsequently been removed. Revisions made over time to this data are summarised below.
