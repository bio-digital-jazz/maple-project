It also has wide ranging capabilities for creating interactive visualisations and camera-ready journal papers. It can be integrated with many other languages and R Studio (the IDE most commonly used to write R) has inbulilt support for many languages including SAS, Latex, C, C++, Haskell, Python, Javascript, HTML and many other languages.\n          </div>\n          <br/>\n          <div>There are a number of excellent resources avaialble to start learning R. <a href=\"#\">DataCamp</a> provides a free introductory course (found <a href=\"#\">here</a>) and there is also a getting started set of tutorials by Greg Hamel (found <a href=\"#\">here</a>. The Hamel tutorials are also avaialble in Python using Jupyter notebooks, and thus provide an opportunity to compare the differences between these two languages. Both Python and R are excellent choices for data science and it will not hurt to learn them both The CIDA project will also be seeking to obtain a site wide licence for <a href=\"#\">DataCamp</a> which provides many in depth data science courses. </div>\n        <br/>\n        \n        <div>\n          Resources can also be found on MOOC sites such as <a href=\"\">Coursera</a> and <a href=\"#\">EDx</a>. An excellent starting point is the <a href=\"#\">John Hopkins University Data Science Specialisation</a>, 10 courses which cover a wide range of data science practics and feature R. There are also a number of other related Data Science courses from <a href=\"#\">John Hopkins University</a> that feature techniques found in bio-statistics. All courses can be audited with no cost.\n          \n        </div>\n        <br/>\n        <div>\n          Another excellent resource is the <a href=\"#\">Applications of Statistical Learning</a> course by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. This resource provides 2 in depth text books covering statistical and machine learning with applications in R, along with 15 hours of lectures. Note that a solid background in statistics is assumed, and concepts are explained through a statistical lens (many other Machine Learning courses tend to utilise ideas more directly from Calculus and Linear Algebra). This is in invaluable resource, and ideal to do after the John Hokpins courses. \n        </div>\n        <br>\n        <br/>\n        \n        \n        <h6>Coding conventions</h6>\n        <div>\n          The Institute adheres to coding conventions for R as set out in the <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#functiondefinition\">Google R Style Guide</a> and adopts the <a href=\"#\">Tidyverse</a>. These style guides includes naming and documentation conventions for variables and functions, extensive information for layout and ordering of code, and commonly used libraries. Note that if you are buidling Shiny Apps and want them to be hosted on the Shiny Server, they <b>must</b> conform to this style guide. You will find this is not overly onerous and makes life easier for everyone, and will make your code cleaner and a joy to work with!</div>\n          <br>\n          <div>\n            The most important aspect of writing code? Readability. This is crtical when writing code in any language and you should always code with this in mind. A great way to work on writing beautiful, clean code is to come along to the <a href=\"#\">R Coders meetup group</a> which meets weekly to pick up lots of great practices.\n          </div>\n          <br/>\n         \n          <br/>\n       \n        \n        <h6>Using R for the data pipeline</h6>\n        <div>\n          The CIDA project uses the R Package <a href=\"#\">DPLYR</a> for all data transformation tasks and does not use SQL. DPLYR is a data query API, and can connect directly to a wide range of different data formats (including SQL, MongoDB, SAS, CSV, Spark, Hadoop, etc) and is designed for optimised lazy loading and portability. It is highly readable and testable. Data transformation tasks of any scope can be carried out using DPLYR and it can generate code in many other languages to carry out data manipulation tasks. An excellence tutorial to use DPLYR can be found on <a href=\"#\">DataCamp</a>.\n          \n        </div>\n        <br/>\n          <br/>\n        \n        <h6>Using templates for Shiny Apps and Notebooks</h6>\n        <div>\n          One of the major strengths of R is its ability to create and deploy data analysis in a wide range fo different formats. These include web applications, Notebooks, PDF, etc. If you are building these you should use the available templates found <a href=\"#\">here</a> as a starting point. \n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n      \n         As part of the project, we are currently working on building a wide range of templates that can be used to quickly get up and running when building data transformation tasks, Shiny Apps, and Notebooks. These include templates for publish ready RBCO visualisations, standard approaches to building apps, notebooks and even ministerial briefs. Developing templates and accompanyting documentation is a great way to explore the R language and if you want to get involved in this part of the project, contact <a href=\"#\">Jamie Gabriel</a> or <a href=\"#\">Richard Walton</a>. \n          \n        </div>\n        \n        <br/>\n          <br/>\n        \n        <h6>R Coders meetup group</h6>\n        <div>\n          The R Coders meetup group happens every <b>Friday at 11am</b> on level 9 at the Cancer Institute NSW. Its the place to meet other developers, share your code, and explore what is happening in data science. Its a broad group has a mixture of different, from those starting out from other languages and moving into data science, through to seasoned data scientists. Its a supportive and friendly environment. And while there is an emphasis on the R language, we also explore Python, SAS and a number of other languages. Anyone is welcome to put up a topic and the kinds of things we would like to cover in 2018 are: <br/>\n          <br/>\n          <li>Getting started on building Shiny Apps.</li>\n          <li>Good code practices and CI naming conventions</li>\n          <li>Using DPLYR just about for any data transformation task you can think of.</li>\n          <li>A tour of the Tidyverse libraries.</li>\n          <li>RBCO templates, and building publication ready visualisations.</li>\n          <li>Why testing and version control matters.</li>\n          <li>Using Jupyter notebooks for R, SAS, Python and more.</li>\n          <li>Why everyone is into Neural networks right now.</li>\n          <li>Data visualisation using base plotting, lattice, and ggplot2.</li>\n          <li>Statistics in R.</li>\n          <li>Machine learning techniques in R and Python.</li>\n          <li>Task Scheduling with R.</li>\n          <li>Setting up a industrial strength data analytics pipeline in Docker.</li>\n          <li>Using Docker to manage your data science stack.</li>\n          <li>Building insanely reactive components using D3.js.</li>\n      \n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          Interested?
