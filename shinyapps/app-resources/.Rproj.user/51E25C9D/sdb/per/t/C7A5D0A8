This allows filters on the data to be passed as parameters in a url, and all results are returned JSON format. Note that, during the CIDA project evaluation there will be limited availability for REST API data, as its predominant use case is for the external provision of data. If data is available via a REST API, this will be noted as part of the data asset's <a href=\"#\">metadata</a><br/>\n     \n        </div>\n        \n        \n    <br/>\n          <br/>\n        \n        <h6>Requesting a copy of a data asset</h6>\n        <div>\n          If it is not possible to access the data through the mechanisms about, you can request a copy of data as a .csv file.
