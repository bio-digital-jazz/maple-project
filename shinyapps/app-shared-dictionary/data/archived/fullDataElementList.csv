CODE 67 Clinical: Determined by Cancer Information Manager 
Clinical diagnostic information has been sighted by the Clinical team and the Cancer Information Manager has determined the best basis of diagnosis available based on the evidence.

CODE 66 Histopathology sighted by Central team:
Histopathology information has been sighted by the Central team and the coder has determined the best basis of diagnosis on the available evidence. This indicates a higher level of evidence has been sighted than Codes 6, 7 and 8. 
General comments:
The most valid basis of diagnosis may be the initial histological examination of the primary site, or it may be the post-mortem examination (sometimes corrected even at this point when histological results become available). In a cancer registry setting, this metadata item should be revised if later information allows its upgrading.

When considering the most valid basis of diagnosis, the minimum requirement of a cancer registry is differentiation between neoplasms that are verified microscopically and those that are not. To exclude the latter group means losing valuable information; the feasibility of making a morphological (histological) diagnosis is dependent upon a variety of factors, such as the health and age of the patient, accessibility of the tumour, availability of medical services, and the beliefs and decisions of the patient.

A biopsy of the primary tumour should be distinguished from a biopsy of a metastasis, for example, at laparotomy; a biopsy of cancer of the head of the pancreas versus a biopsy of a metastasis in the mesentery. However, when insufficient information is available, Code 8 should be used for any histological diagnosis. Cytological and histological diagnoses should be distinguished. 

Morphological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of malignancy depends on the successful removal of a piece of tissue that is cancerous. Especially when using endoscopic procedures (bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, laparoscopy, etc.), the clinician may miss the tumour with the biopsy forceps. These cases must be registered on the basis of endoscopic diagnosis and not excluded through lack of a morphological diagnosis. 

Care must be taken in the interpretation and subsequent coding of autopsy findings, which may vary as follows: 

a) the post-mortem report includes the post-mortem histological diagnosis (in which case, one of the histology codes should be recorded instead);

b) the autopsy is macroscopic only, histological investigations having been carried out only during life (in which case, one of the histology codes should be recorded instead); 

c) the autopsy findings are not supported by any histological diagnosis.

The reporting standard for the size of solid tumours is:

?Breast cancer or other solid neoplasms - the largest tumour dimension, measured to a precision of 1mm
?Round to the nearest millimetre, rounding up if size is ? .5 mm (e.g. 1.50mm, 1.54mm recorded as 2mm, 1.47mm recorded as 1mm).
General coding rules:

Recorded size:

?Only record measured size if stated, otherwise record size as unknown. Do not attempt to estimate size from descriptions of the tumour, such as 'tumour occupying three quarters of tissue'
?Do not take values for size from sources other than histopathology (such as imaging, mammography or clinical examination).
Size reported for multiple specimens:

?If tumour is removed in more than one procedure (e.g. biopsy and excision, local excision and re-excision) do not sum the sizes across multiple pathology reports but rather use the larger of the measured sizes from the separate pathology reports
?If tumour is divided into several parts (in the same pathology report), do not sum sizes together but rather use the larger of the measured sizes. However, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size, record that size.
Multifocal tumour:
?If the tumour is multifocal, record the size of the largest measured focus. Do not attempt to sum sizes of different foci.
Macroscopic size:
?If only macroscopic size is given, record this value
?If the macroscopic and microscopic measurements differ, the microscopic measurement should be recorded.
Exclusions:
?Size is not recorded for Phyllodes tumours, sarcomas, or lymphomas.
Invasive breast cancer coding rules:
Note: These rules are to be used only when the record pertains to an invasive breast cancer (as per Person with cancer-primary site of cancer, topography code (ICD-O-3) ANN.N.
Invasive tumours with an in situ component:
?When an invasive tumour contains an in situ component, only record the size of the invasive component as stated
?If the size of the invasive tumour is not recorded separately to the in situ component, then record the total size of the tumour without any attempt to estimate the invasive component using percentage or size of the in situ component.
Microinvasive tumour:
?For microinvasive tumours, record size in millimetres if stated. If microinvasion is stated but no size is recorded, enter 990 in size field to enable these very small tumours to be differentiated from other tumours without measured sizes.
Bilateral breasts tumours:
?Bilateral tumours are recorded as two separate primary tumours each having their own size (and other data elements). 
Multifocal tumours with different morphology: 
?Foci with different morphology should be considered to be separate primary tumours each having their own size (and other data elements). The coder needs to ascertain whether two foci with differing morphology are separate primaries with different morphology or a single multifocal primary with a mixed histology. In the latter case the rule of taking the size from the larger focus would apply as stated."

Record the date the first recurrence of cancer is diagnosed.

The term recurrence defines the return, reappearance or metastasis of cancer (of the same histology) after a disease free period. 

The date is based on the most definitive diagnostic information available and ideally should correspond to the date of the investigation recorded in data element Person with cancer-most valid basis of diagnosis of the first recurrence. For instance, record the date of the first histological or if unavailable, cytological investigation confirming the diagnosis of recurrence. If these investigations have not been performed, record the date of confirmation by clinical investigation.

This information should be obtained from the patient's medical record. In the first instance, the diagnosis date should be derived from the relevant investigation report; for example, tissue diagnosis from the pathology report and imaging from the imaging reports. 

If the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical examination, record the date this is performed. For example, this may be the date of a consultation, an outpatient appointment or the date the patient is admitted to hospital.

If the patient was diagnosed by clinical examination and/or investigations performed elsewhere, the date may be found in a letter of referral from a recognised medical practitioner or dentist. Usually the relevant test result, if applicable, will be attached to this.

In some cases, the date the patient states they were diagnosed with recurrence will be the only date available and should be recorded here. For example, the patient may have been diagnosed whilst overseas.

If components of the date are not known, an estimate should be provided where possible with an estimated date flag to indicate that it is estimated. If an estimated date is not possible, a standard date of 15 June 1900 should be used with a flag to indicate the date is not known.

Includes a primary cancer where the spread is contained within the organ of origin. Note: this includes in situ breast (D05.0-D05.9) and in situ melanoma (D03.0-D03.9)
Example 1: For colon cancer, the cancer has not progressed into the adventitia (peritoneal layer) surrounding the colon.
Example 2: For breast cancer, the cancer has not progressed into the underlying muscle layer (pectoral) or externally to the skin.
Example 3: For melanoma of the skin, the cancer has not invaded the subcutaneous fat layer (that is, it is contained within the dermis and epidermis).
Example 4: For lung cancer, the cancer has not invaded the pleura.

CODE 2     Invasion of adjacent tissue or organs
A primary cancer has spread to adjacent organs or tissue not forming part of the organ of origin. This category includes sub-cutaneous fat or muscle and organs adjacent to the primary cancer site.
Example 1: For colon cancer, the cancer has progressed into the adventitia (peritoneal layer) surrounding the colon.
Example 2:For breast cancer, the degree of spread has progressed into the underlying muscle layer (pectoral) or externally into the skin.
Example 3: For melanoma of the skin, the cancer has invaded into subcutaneous fat or muscle.
Example 4: For lung cancer, the cancer has invaded the pleura or tissues of the mediastinum.

Mismatch repair deficient (MMRD) cancers occur either sporadically (~12%) or less commonly (~2%) because the individual suffers from hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Tumours which show loss of MMR proteins by immunohistochemistry are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI), which is determined by analysis of tumour DNA.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of mismatch repair proteins is used to detect MMRD in colorectal cancer, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result. MMRD can also be determined by microsatellite analysis, which is the amplification and analysis of selected microsatellite loci within the genome of the tumour cells. However, this later technique is not used routinely in diagnostic pathology settings. MMR testing is currently recommended for all cases of colorectal cancer arising in individuals less than 50 years of age, although this cut off is arbitrary.

General coding rules:

Recorded size:

?Only record measured size if stated, otherwise record size as unknown. Do not attempt to estimate size from descriptions of the tumour, such as 'tumour occupying three quarters of tissue'
?Do not take values for size from sources other than histopathology (such as imaging, mammography or clinical examination).
Size reported for multiple specimens:

?If tumour is removed in more than one procedure (e.g. biopsy and excision, local excision and re-excision) do not sum the sizes across multiple pathology reports but rather use the larger of the measured sizes from the separate pathology reports
?If tumour is divided into several parts (in the same pathology report), do not sum sizes together but rather use the larger of the measured sizes. However, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size, record that size.
Multifocal tumour:
?If the tumour is multifocal, record the size of the largest measured focus. Do not attempt to sum sizes of different foci.

Radioactive colloids (isotopes) are injected around the tumour or beneath the areola prior to surgery. Lymphoscintigraphy is then undertaken to identify the position of the sentinel node (axillary, internal mammary or other). During surgery, the sentinel node is identified by the surgeon using a hand held Gamma probe. The sentinel node displays much higher levels of radioactivity than the background tissues.
Blue dye is also used to facilitate intraoperative identification of the sentinel node. Patent blue dye is injected into the breast around the tumour or beneath the areola. Axillary nodes that are blue in colour are identified as sentinel nodes."

Dates relating to targeted therapies using a systemic agent therapy agent are included.  Targeted therapies are treatments that use drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. 

Dates of surgery, radiotherapy and other systemic therapy procedures are collected as separate items. However, if a patient receives treatment with a protocol that includes different types of systemic therapy agents, for example, a chemotherapy agent and a hormone therapy agent, record the start date of treatment in both relevant data items."

CODES 1-7
Systemic agent therapy includes:
?chemotherapy 
?hormone therapy 
?immunotherapy
Or any combination of the above therapies.

Systemic therapy procedures are recorded separately.

CODE 0 - Active surveillance
Closely following a patient?s condition but not giving treatment unless there are changes in test results. Active surveillance may avoid or delay the need for radiation or surgery. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests, including biopsies, are done on a regular schedule as a type of expectant management. Active Surveillance is the name given to monitoring a cancer without treating it. It is sometimes used when there is reluctance to treat a low grade cancer.

Selecting Active Surveillance/Watchful Waiting as a treatment type tracks active surveillance as a form of treatment and whether or not the patient received treatment.

The T stage value is derived from the size of the tumour and its relationship (extension) to other structures. The size is reflected in the value of data element Person with cancer?solid tumour size (at diagnosis), total millimetres NNN; the usage attributes provide additional detail.

The extent of the primary cancer at this episode is usually recorded. An exception is malignant melanoma of the skin; by convention T stage is recorded after tumour excision and is based on tumour thickness with T subcategories based on ulceration and the number of mitoses seen. Ovarian cancer is also surgically/pathologically staged.

NSW Data
Information about deaths should be submitted by the NSW RBDM every two weeks, however frequently the interval is longer. The data are selected by the RBDM based on date of registration, not date of death. They usually cover the period up to oneweek before the data are extracted.

The NSWCR uses the following process to identify missing data:
1. A program identifies gaps in the death certificate number sequence. Missing records are requested from the RBDM. However there is always a small number of deaths for which only an ABS record exists.
2. Once the ABS provides the coded death data (up to two years later), the NSWCR receives imited information about deaths that the RBDM has notified to the ABS but not to the NSWCR. The ABS does not supply names and so the NSWCR has no means of matching those deaths with the cancer registry database. These deaths are flagged as ?ABS-only?. 

ACT Data
The ACT RBDM submits data to the NSWCR at the beginning of each month. The file contains data up to a few days before the end of the month.

The NSWCR also receives a small number of ""ABS-only"" deaths for the ACT.

Each person's Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) is unique within the Australian health care system. Record the full Individual Healthcare Identifier for an individual. The IHI is part of the government's e?health initiative developed to enhance the way information is exchanged, shared and managed in the Australian health sector. Electronic identifiers and the systems underpinning them were developed and are
maintained by Medicare Australia. Individual Healthcare Identifiers are automatically assigned to all individuals registered with Medicare Australia or enrolled in the Department of Veterans' Affairs
(DVA) programs. Those not enrolled in Medicare Australia or with the Department of Veterans' Affairs are assigned a temporary number when they next seek healthcare; this is then validated by the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service Operator and becomes their unique IHI.

Only the individual, authorised healthcare providers and their authorised staff can access an individual's IHI number. Each Individual Healthcare Identifier has an Identifier Status; this describes whether
verification of the identifier of the individual has occurred and is based on the evidence available of a person's identity: 

Verified: All individuals eligible for Medicare or DVA benefits are assigned a verified IHI automatically.
Unverified: For individuals whose identifier cannot be retrieved and who have an IHI created for them at the point of care. This caters, for instance, for newborns and overseas visitors.
Provisional: Individuals who present at the point of care unconscious or unknown may be assigned a provisional IHI by the healthcare provider. This IHI expires after 90 days of inactivity on the assumption the patient will become known and a verified IHI obtained for them, or their IHI will be converted to an unverified IHI.

The IHI number does not change regardless of the person's Identifier Status. All healthcare identifiers use the International Standard ISO 7812?1:2006 that specifies the numbering system for identification cards. The format of the number is as follows:

Digits N1?N6: Consists of the issuer identification number
N1?N2 Major industry identifier: 80 = health N3?N5 Country code: 036 = Australia
N6 Number type: 0 = IHI

This data element may be used in the analysis of data on a geographical basis which involves a conversion from postcodes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) postal areas. This conversion results in some inaccuracy of information as postcodes do not have a geographic definition and boundaries are not well defined. However, in some data sets postcode is the only geographic identifier, therefore the use of other more accurate indicators (e.g. Statistical areas - SA) is not always possible. 

When dealing with aggregate data, postal areas, converted from postcodes, can be mapped to Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) codes using an ABS concordance, for example to determine SA1s. For a more advanced concordance, locality, postcode and state, which are all part of an address, used in conjunction can effectively code data to the SA2 level and above in the ASGS.
