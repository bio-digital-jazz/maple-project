CODE 2 Clinical investigation: diagnostic procedure code(s) only. No further information has been sighted by the Clinical Cancer Registry program.

CODE 67 Clinical: Determined by Cancer Information Manager 
Clinical diagnostic information has been sighted by the Clinical team and the Cancer Information Manager has determined the best basis of diagnosis available based on the evidence. This may include, but is not limited to, clinical notes, test results, images, and letters. This indicates a 'higher level of evidence' has been sighted than Code 2, procedure codes only.
CODE 66 Histopathology sighted by Central team:
Histopathology information has been sighted by the Central team and the coder has determined the best basis of diagnosis on the available evidence. This indicates a higher level of evidence has been sighted than Codes 6, 7 and 8. 
General comments:
The most valid basis of diagnosis may be the initial histological examination of the primary site, or it may be the post-mortem examination (sometimes corrected even at this point when histological results become available). In a cancer registry setting, this metadata item should be revised if later information allows its upgrading.

When considering the most valid basis of diagnosis, the minimum requirement of a cancer registry is differentiation between neoplasms that are verified microscopically and those that are not. To exclude the latter group means losing valuable information; the feasibility of making a morphological (histological) diagnosis is dependent upon a variety of factors, such as the health and age of the patient, accessibility of the tumour, availability of medical services, and the beliefs and decisions of the patient.

A biopsy of the primary tumour should be distinguished from a biopsy of a metastasis, for example, at laparotomy; a biopsy of cancer of the head of the pancreas versus a biopsy of a metastasis in the mesentery. However, when insufficient information is available, Code 8 should be used for any histological diagnosis. Cytological and histological diagnoses should be distinguished. 

Morphological confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of malignancy depends on the successful removal of a piece of tissue that is cancerous. Especially when using endoscopic procedures (bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, laparoscopy, etc.), the clinician may miss the tumour with the biopsy forceps. These cases must be registered on the basis of endoscopic diagnosis and not excluded through lack of a morphological diagnosis. 

Care must be taken in the interpretation and subsequent coding of autopsy findings, which may vary as follows: 

a) the post-mortem report includes the post-mortem histological diagnosis (in which case, one of the histology codes should be recorded instead);

b) the autopsy is macroscopic only, histological investigations having been carried out only during life (in which case, one of the histology codes should be recorded instead); 

c) the autopsy findings are not supported by any histological diagnosis.

The Standard Australian Classification of Countries (SACC) is a four-digit, three-level hierarchical structure specifying major group, minor group and country.

A country, even if it comprises other discrete political entities such as states, is treated as a single unit for all data domain purposes. Parts of a political entity are not included in different groups.

This data element may be used in the analysis of data on a geographical basis which involves a conversion from postcodes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) postal areas. This conversion results in some inaccuracy of information as postcodes do not have a geographic definition and boundaries are not well defined. However, in some data sets postcode is the only geographic identifier, therefore the use of other more accurate indicators (e.g. Statistical areas - SA) is not always possible. 

When dealing with aggregate data, postal areas, converted from postcodes, can be mapped to Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) codes using an ABS concordance, for example to determine SA1s. For a more advanced concordance, locality, postcode and state, which are all part of an address, used in conjunction can effectively code data to the SA2 level and above in the ASGS.

?Do not take values for size from sources other than histopathology (such as imaging, mammography or clinical examination).
Size reported for multiple specimens:

?If tumour is removed in more than one procedure (e.g. biopsy and excision, local excision and re-excision) do not sum the sizes across multiple pathology reports but rather use the larger of the measured sizes from the separate pathology reports
?If tumour is divided into several parts (in the same pathology report), do not sum sizes together but rather use the larger of the measured sizes. However, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size, record that size.
Multifocal tumour:
?If the tumour is multifocal, record the size of the largest measured focus. Do not attempt to sum sizes of different foci.
Macroscopic size:

This information should be obtained from the patient's medical record. In the first instance, the diagnosis date should be derived from the relevant investigation report; for example, tissue diagnosis from the pathology report and imaging from the imaging reports. 

If the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical examination, record the date this is performed. For example, this may be the date of a consultation, an outpatient appointment or the date the patient is admitted to hospital.

If the patient was diagnosed by clinical examination and/or investigations performed elsewhere, the date may be found in a letter of referral from a recognised medical practitioner or dentist. Usually the relevant test result, if applicable, will be attached to this.

In some cases, the date the patient states they were diagnosed with recurrence will be the only date available and should be recorded here. For example, the patient may have been diagnosed whilst overseas.

If components of the date are not known, an estimate should be provided where possible with an estimated date flag to indicate that it is estimated. If an estimated date is not possible, a standard date of 15 June 1900 should be used with a flag to indicate the date is not known.

Mismatch repair deficient (MMRD) cancers occur either sporadically (~12%) or less commonly (~2%) because the individual suffers from hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Tumours which show loss of MMR proteins by immunohistochemistry are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI), which is determined by analysis of tumour DNA.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of mismatch repair proteins is used to detect MMRD in colorectal cancer, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result. MMRD can also be determined by microsatellite analysis, which is the amplification and analysis of selected microsatellite loci within the genome of the tumour cells. However, this later technique is not used routinely in diagnostic pathology settings. MMR testing is currently recommended for all cases of colorectal cancer arising in individuals less than 50 years of age, although this cut off is arbitrary.

Recorded size:

?Only record measured size if stated, otherwise record size as unknown. Do not attempt to estimate size from descriptions of the tumour, such as 'tumour occupying three quarters of tissue'
?Do not take values for size from sources other than histopathology (such as imaging, mammography or clinical examination).
Size reported for multiple specimens:

?If tumour is removed in more than one procedure (e.g. biopsy and excision, local excision and re-excision) do not sum the sizes across multiple pathology reports but rather use the larger of the measured sizes from the separate pathology reports
?If tumour is divided into several parts (in the same pathology report), do not sum sizes together but rather use the larger of the measured sizes. However, if the pathologist states an aggregate or composite size, record that size.
Multifocal tumour:
?If the tumour is multifocal, record the size of the largest measured focus. Do not attempt to sum sizes of different foci.
Macroscopic size:
?If only macroscopic size is given, record this value
?If the macroscopic and microscopic measurements differ, the microscopic measurement should be recorded.
Exclusions:

Invasive breast cancer coding rules:
Note: These rules are to be used only when the record pertains to an invasive breast cancer (as per Person with cancer-primary site of cancer, topography code (ICD-O-3) ANN.N.
Invasive tumours with an in situ component:
?When an invasive tumour contains an in situ component, only record the size of the invasive component as stated
?If the size of the invasive tumour is not recorded separately to the in situ component, then record the total size of the tumour without any attempt to estimate the invasive component using percentage or size of the in situ component.
Microinvasive tumour:
?For microinvasive tumours, record size in millimetres if stated. If microinvasion is stated but no size is recorded, enter 990 in size field to enable these very small tumours to be differentiated from other tumours without measured sizes.
Bilateral breasts tumours:
?Bilateral tumours are recorded as two separate primary tumours each having their own size (and other data elements). 
Multifocal tumours with different morphology: 
?Foci with different morphology should be considered to be separate primary tumours each having their own size (and other data elements). The coder needs to ascertain whether two foci with differing morphology are separate primaries with different morphology or a single multifocal primary with a mixed histology. In the latter case the rule of taking the size from the larger focus would apply as stated."

Lymphatic mapping techniques include the use of radioactive colloids (isotopes) and blue dyes that are injected into the breast and preferentially enter the lymphatics. These agents are taken up by the sentinel node(s) and facilitate intraoperative identification of the node by the surgeon.
Radioactive colloids (isotopes) are injected around the tumour or beneath the areola prior to surgery. Lymphoscintigraphy is then undertaken to identify the position of the sentinel node (axillary, internal mammary or other). During surgery, the sentinel node is identified by the surgeon using a hand held Gamma probe. The sentinel node displays much higher levels of radioactivity than the background tissues.
Blue dye is also used to facilitate intraoperative identification of the sentinel node. Patent blue dye is injected into the breast around the tumour or beneath the areola. Axillary nodes that are blue in colour are identified as sentinel nodes."

The initial course of treatment includes all treatments administered to the patient from diagnosis and before disease progression or recurrence.

Systemic therapy agents are drugs that travel through the bloodstream and reach and effect cells all over the body. They are administered orally or intravenously.

Systemic therapy may involve a single agent or a combination regimen of two or more drugs. They are administered in treatment cycles. 

A protocol is a precise and detailed plan for therapy that includes the type, quantity, method and length of time of taking the drugs required for any treatment cycle.

The systemic therapy agent eviQ protocol identifier applies to chemotherapy, hormone therapy and immunotherapy administered for the treatment of cancer.

It is suggested that the estimated date of birth of children aged under 2 years should be reported to the nearest 3 month period, i.e. 0101, 0104, 0107, 0110 of the estimated year of birth. For example, a child who is thought to be aged 18 months in October of one year would have his/her estimated date of birth reported as 0104 of the previous year.

1. A program identifies gaps in the death certificate number sequence. Missing records are requested from the RBDM. However there is always a small number of deaths for which only an ABS record exists.

Each person's Individual Healthcare Identifier (IHI) is unique within the Australian health care system. Record the full Individual Healthcare Identifier for an individual.

maintained by Medicare Australia. Individual Healthcare Identifiers are automatically assigned to all individuals registered with Medicare Australia or enrolled in the Department of Veterans' Affairs
(DVA) programs. Those not enrolled in Medicare Australia or with the Department of Veterans' Affairs are assigned a temporary number when they next seek healthcare; this is then validated by the Healthcare Identifiers (HI) Service Operator and becomes their unique IHI.

Unverified: For individuals whose identifier cannot be retrieved and who have an IHI created for them at the point of care. This caters, for instance, for newborns and overseas visitors.

This data element may be used in the analysis of data on a geographical basis which involves a conversion from postcodes to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) postal areas. This conversion results in some inaccuracy of information as postcodes do not have a geographic definition and boundaries are not well defined. However, in some data sets postcode is the only geographic identifier, therefore the use of other more accurate indicators (e.g. Statistical areas - SA) is not always possible. 

When dealing with aggregate data, postal areas, converted from postcodes, can be mapped to Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) codes using an ABS concordance, for example to determine SA1s. For a more advanced concordance, locality, postcode and state, which are all part of an address, used in conjunction can effectively code data to the SA2 level and above in the ASGS.
