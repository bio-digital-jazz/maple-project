Its aim is create an end-to-end data solution for governance and analytics. It provides a platform from which to explore a number of modern approaches in data science and is scalable to big data. Technologies used for this project include R Studio and R Shiny Server, Apache Kafka, Spark, and Atlas. The project also aims to further develop the data science Community in the Institute by standardising practices and tools and providing a mechanism for staff to showcase thier analytics.</div>\n          <br/>\n        <div>The CIDA project was designed to be highly agile in order to leverage new developments in data science tooling and techniques. Both the web platform and accompanying infrastructure was completed over a 3 month period from March through July, 2018. This project is currently in an evaluation phase until late 2018. \n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        </div>\n        \n        <h6>Governance Platform</h6>\n        <div>\n        The CIDA platform holds all data specifications for the Institute's 80+ data assets. It tracks and approves users and roles, and provides an interactive data dictionary for all data elements. For a number of collections, extended research usage notes are also available which have been built as embedded applications and notebooks. The platform tracks data element coverage and quality over time, and tracks event level interactions in all applications for the purpose of analytics. \n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n        <h6>Analytics and reporting</h6>\n        <div>\n          The CIDA platform is built an an R analytics server which allows the creation of embedded apps and markdown reports. This tooling can be used to rapidly build and deploy PFM style analytics and it meets the requirements to take RBCO reporint online and be highly interactive. Usage patterns can also be explored. There are also several templates available for staff (from creating analytics applications, journal ready reporting with reproducible research and ad-hoc reporting)\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n        <h6>Rethinking ETL</h6>\n        <div>\n          A key driver behind the CIDA project was to demonstrate more modern approaches that can be taken  ETL processes. The institute currently accesses several external datasets and software systems which provide data in a range of different formats. The first phrase of this project usilise the <a href=\"\"> DPLYR </a> library in R heavily to demonstrate how one language can be used across the pipeline in best practice way.\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          For further infromation, or to get involved in this project, contact: <br/><br/>\n             <a href=\"#\">Jamie Gabriel </a><br/>\n             <b>Project Lead - Infrastructure</b><br/>\n             <br/>\n             <a href=\"#\">Richard Walton</a><br/>\n             <b>Project Lead - Analytics</b>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n      \n  </div>\n</div>\n",
