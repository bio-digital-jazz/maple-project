Note that this dictionary is currently under active development and not yet in beta. Data Elements will be iteratively added to the dictionary as they become available. As of September 2018, this dictionary tracks most data elements found in the following data assets:</div>\n  <br/>\n  <div>\n    <li>Extract - NSWCR System</li>\n    <li>Analytics - NSWCR Incidence and Mortality Dataset</li>\n    <li>Analytics - NSWCR Minimum Dataset</li>\n    <li>Analytics - NSWCR Clinical Notification Dataset</li>\n    \n  </div>\n  <br/>\n  <div>\n    As new data elements come online this list will be updated. Note that the Institute has almost 80 data assets to onboard and this data dictionary will see many changes in the near future.  \n  </div>\n\n  <br/>\n  <h4>Dictionary naming conventions</h4>\n    <div>\n  The Institute uses camel case (thisIsCamelCase) for naming data elements. This convention is used in order to standardise naming across different data sets, and to remove spaces in data element names which can lead to problems when undertaking analytics tasks. Data element names also begin with a leading uppercase character which indicates the category of data element. The different categories currently in use are listed below: \n    \n  </div>\n  \n   <br/>\n  \n  <li>Person (A)</li>\n  <li>Case (B)</li>\n  <li>Episode (C)</li>\n  <li>Health Practitioner (D)</li>\n  <li>Health Organisation (E)</li>\n  <li>Grant (F)</li>\n  <li>Clinical Trial (G)</li>\n  <li>Other (H)</li>\n\n<div>\n  <br/>\n  Examples following this naming convention include \"APostcode\", \"ABirthDate\", postcode and birth date data elements with a person annotation signified by \"A\", and \"BLaterality\", laterality of case. Note that all data elements are in the form of nouns. Prepositions and conjunctions (such as \"of\", \"and\" etc.) have been removed where possible (for example, \"ABirthDate\", not \"ADateOfBirth\"). Where acronyms are used, they are in upper case (for example, \"BTNMStagingCode\"). There a are several examples in the data which use \"ID\" interchangeably with \"code\". All of these examples have been conformed to use \"code\".\n  \n  \n</div>\n<br/>\n<h4>Using the data dictionary</h4>\n\n  <div>This data dictionary allows uses to track all data elements, the different ways in which data elements are used in data assets, extended usage notes, and coverage and quality metrics. Users can also download and create their own custom data dictionaries. The <i>Data elements</i> tab provides detailed information for each of the data element (including name, definition, type, accepted value, etc). The <i>Data element uses</i> tab describes ways these data elements can be transformed from source data into analytics data. The <i>Extended usage notes</i> tab provides extended usage notes for data elements where they are available. The <i>Coverage and quality metrics</i> tab provides provides various coverage and quality metrics that can be used to ascertain the quality of data elements. The <i>Data dictionary</i> provides dowloadable vesion of subsets of the dictionary, and allows users to contsruct custom dictionaries.</div>\n  \n<br/>\n\n  <h4>Making changes to the data dictionary</h4>\n<div>\n  The data dictionary is a living document and will see changes over time. To submit a change proposal to this data dictionary, contact the <a href=\"#\">Data Quality Framework Group</a> in the Institute. Note that changes will have impacts on existing and future research and the change log will be made available as part of this application. \n</div>\n\n<br/>\n\n  <h4>Version</h4>\n<div>\n  The current version of this dictionary is 0.1 (as of July, 2018) and it is expected fo beta release in October 2018. Note that this dictionary is under heavy active development and is expected to be in beta by late 2018. After beta release, archived versions of the dictionary will be made available from this page.\n</div>\n\n",
